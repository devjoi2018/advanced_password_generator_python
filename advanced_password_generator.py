# This code is part of the tests that I have been doing with Github Copilot.

# Program that generates a list of passwords randomly
# The length of the password must be requested from the user through the console
# The user should be asked if they want to include special characters in the opassword
# If the user selects 'y', a password must be generated with special characters and with uppercase lowercase letters and numbers randomly
# If the user chooses 'n', a password must be generated with uppercase lowercase letters and numbers randomly
# The user should be asked if they want to generate more passwords or not
# The user should be asked if he wants to store the list of passwords in a text file
# A folder selector will open that allows the user to select where they want to save the text file
